The customer is looking for \"shipping envelopes\" that are \"pretty\" and \"thick.\"  \n2. Envelopes should be \"durable\" and \"not rip easily.\"  \n3. The design should be \"beautiful.\"  \n4. The customer has ordered similar products before and was satisfied, indicating a preference for reliable options.\n\nTo expand the query, we can consider additional relevant keywords and phrases:  \n- \"Pretty\" and \"beautiful\" can be expanded with terms like \"aesthetic,\" \"elegant,\" \"stylish,\" or \"decorative.\"  \n- \"Thick\" and \"durable\" can be associated with \"sturdy,\" \"strong,\" and \"tear-resistant.\"  \n- Since the customer packaging lashes, terms like \"cosmetic packaging\" or \"beauty product packaging\" could be relevant.  \n- Mentioning \"customer satisfaction\" or \"highly rated\" could imply quality and reliability.  \n\nCombining these expansions while retaining the original information can yield a more comprehensive query for dense retrieval.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n{\n    \"query\": \"I want to find pretty and thick shipping envelopes for my lashes.
