I want to purchase one panel and connect it to my Bluetti EB150, which currently has a 50% charge. I want the panel to provide a charge rate of at least 101 watts, and hopefully higher. If the charging rate drops slightly due to clouds or other factors, it's acceptable. Based on the positive experience with one panel, I decided to order two more panels because my Pecron s1500 requires higher voltage and won't charge with just one panel. I connected the two panels in series and measured a charge rate of up to 165 watts, but mainly around 125 watts. This is sufficient for my needs. I also like the option to connect the panels in parallel to increase the charge rate for the Bluetti. It's important that the panels arrive on time and without any damage. I understand that I need to aim the panels towards the sun, although I may have to use a \"\"best guess\"\" method. Finally, due to time constraints, I didn't fully charge either unit using the panels, but even with just 3 hours of charging, the Pecron's charge level increased from 39%\"```\n\nThen, generate a structured Boolean search query based on the user's natural language query.\n\nYour final response must be in JSON format within <answer> </answer> tags.
