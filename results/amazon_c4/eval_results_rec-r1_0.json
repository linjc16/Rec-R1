I want something incredibly comfortable, with a medium firmness that can conform to my body. However, I also need it to have a strong base layer that provides full support. It's important to note that this type of foam mattress doesn't have a rigid wire edge, so I'll need to be careful not to roll out of bed. The mattress comes in a rectangular box with the brand's logo on it, not a brown Amazon box. It's vacuum-sealed in a thick plastic bag and expands quickly to its full size once opened. I didn't notice any smells, but I aired out the room just in case. The mattress is quite deep, so I'll need to purchase deep twin sheets in the future, but that's not a big deal since my son needs new sheets anyway.```\n\nThen, generate a structured Boolean search query based on the user's natural language query.\n\nYour final response must be in JSON format within <answer> </answer> tags.
